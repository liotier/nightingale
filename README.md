  Karaoke from any song in your music library, powered by neural networks.
</p>

---

Nightingale scans your music folder, separates lead vocals from instrumentals using the [UVR Karaoke model](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui) (or [Demucs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs)), transcribes lyrics with word-level timestamps via [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX), and plays it all back with synchronized highlighting, pitch scoring, profiles, and dynamic backgrounds.

Ships as a single binary. No manual installation of Python, ffmpeg, or ML models required — everything is downloaded and bootstrapped automatically on first launch.

## Features

🎤 **Stem Separation** — isolates lead vocals from instrumentals using the UVR Karaoke model (default) or Demucs, with adjustable guide vocal volume. The karaoke model preserves backing vocals in the instrumental for a more natural sound

📝 **Word-Level Lyrics** — automatic transcription with alignment, or fetched from [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net) when available

🎯 **Pitch Scoring** — real-time microphone input with pitch detection, star ratings, and per-song scoreboards

👤 **Profiles** — create and switch between player profiles; scores are tracked per profile

🎬 **Video Files** — drop video files (`.mp4`, `.mkv`, etc.) into your music folder; vocals are separated from the audio track and the original video plays as a synchronized background

🌌 **7 Background Themes** — 5 GPU shader backgrounds (Plasma, Aurora, Waves, Nebula, Starfield), Pixabay video backgrounds with 5 flavors (Nature, Underwater, Space, City, Countryside), plus automatic source video playback for video files

🎮 **Gamepad Support** — full navigation and control via gamepad (D-pad, sticks, face buttons)

📺 **Adaptive UI Scaling** — scales to any resolution including 4K TVs

📦 **Self-Contained** — ffmpeg, uv, Python, PyTorch, and ML packages are all downloaded to `~/.nightingale/vendor/` on first run. Video backgrounds are pre-downloaded during setup so the first session is ready to go

## Quick start

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](../../releases) page and run it. On first launch, Nightingale will set up its Python environment and download ML models — this takes a few minutes and shows a progress screen.

### macOS

macOS quarantines files downloaded from the internet. Since Nightingale isn't signed with an Apple Developer ID, Gatekeeper will block it with a message like *"app is damaged and can't be opened"*. To fix this, remove the quarantine attribute after extracting:

```bash
xattr -cr Nightingale.app
```

### Supported formats

Audio: `.mp3`, `.flac`, `.ogg`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, `.aac`, `.wma`. Video: `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.webm`, `.mov`, `.m4v`.

```

Analysis results are cached at `~/.nightingale/cache/` using blake3 file hashes. Re-analysis only happens if the source file changes or is manually triggered.

## Hardware

The Python analyzer uses PyTorch and auto-detects the best backend:

| Backend | Device | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CUDA | NVIDIA GPU | Fastest |
| MPS | Apple Silicon | macOS; WhisperX alignment falls back to CPU |
| CPU | Any | Slowest but always works |

The UVR Karaoke model uses ONNX Runtime and enables CUDA acceleration automatically on NVIDIA GPUs, or CoreML on Apple Silicon.

A song typically takes 2–5 minutes on GPU, 10–20 minutes on CPU.

## Data storage

Everything lives under `~/.nightingale/`:

```

├── config.json         # App settings

### Video backgrounds

Pixabay video backgrounds use the [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/). The API key is embedded in release builds. For development, create a `.env` file at the project root:

```
PIXABAY_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

The release script (`make-release.sh`) sources `.env` automatically.
